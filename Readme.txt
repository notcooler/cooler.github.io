I didn't code this website.
imagine seeing me using css in 2022.(I don't say css is bad, I suck at using it)

Anyways thanks for https://bootstrapmade.com/ for letting me steal their free portofolio website.
and yaclive for matrix background, https://codepen.io/yaclive/pen/EayLYO

i changed some things tho i aint that bad in coding.
